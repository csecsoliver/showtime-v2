The second iteration of a workshop scheduling app made for my mother and her specific needs. So far I've only got the basics down, but feel free to poke around and submit feedback here and through slack @olio. Invites are not yet impemented.

Currently all people signing up will get the teacher role and are able to create and manage workshops. All users can also join workshops and confirmations also work. 

My technologies are lapis with moonscript and all the random lua packages I decided to randomly use.

This is not the best project for community voting, but I hope you can appreciate it a little bit.
