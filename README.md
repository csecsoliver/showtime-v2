The second iteration of a workshop scheduling app made for my mother and her specific needs. So far I've only got the basics down, but feel free to poke around and submit feedback here and through slack @olio. Invites are implemented now, but be sure to input a real email for it to work (the same you used to sign up will also work).

Currently all people signing up will get the teacher role and are able to create and manage workshops. All users can also join workshops and confirmations also work. 

My technologies are lapis with moonscript and all the random lua packages I decided to use.
